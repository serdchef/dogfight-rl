Dogfight RL
Dogfight RL is a custom reinforcement learning (RL) environment developed for simulating an aerial dogfight between two agents. This project simulates the physical dynamics of aircraft (including thrust, drag, gravity, and wind) and trains a model using the PPO algorithm from Stable-Baselines3. Additionally, hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna, and performance is visualized with Matplotlib.

Features
Custom Dogfight Environment:
Simulates aerial combat dynamics between two agents (aircraft) with realistic physical behavior.

Physical Simulation:
The movement of the aircraft is calculated based on forces such as thrust, drag, gravity, and wind. The aircraft's rotations are computed using the scipy library.

Reward Function:
A multi-dimensional reward function is defined based on distance, weapon usage, health, and fuel levels.

Training with PPO:
The PPO algorithm from Stable-Baselines3 is used to train the model.

Hyperparameter Optimization:
Model performance is enhanced through hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.

Performance Monitoring and Visualization:
Training and testing metrics are tracked and graphically displayed using Matplotlib.

Installation
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Gymnasium
Stable-Baselines3
PyTorch
NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Optuna
Step-by-Step Installation
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install Required Packages:

Create a requirements.txt file in the project root directory with the following content:

txt
Copy
gymnasium
stable-baselines3
torch
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
optuna
Then, install the packages by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training
Run the main file to train the model. For example:

bash
Copy
python any.py
During training:

The environment is created and tested.
Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna.
The PPO model is trained using the selected hyperparameters.
Rewards and other metrics are logged and visualized during training.
Model Testing
After training is complete:

You can test the model using either a single model or an ensemble of models.
Test results are reported with metrics such as episode rewards, survival time, and health statuses.
